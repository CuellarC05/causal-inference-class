# Causal Inference Class

## Overview
Welcome to the **Causal Inference Class** repository! This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of causal inference, the distinction between correlation and causation, and the methodologies used to establish causal relationships in economics and social sciences.

This repository will serve as the main resource hub for lecture materials, coding exercises, and assignments. We will use **Google Colab** to implement data analysis and causal inference methods.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand the principles of causal inference and why they matter in economics.
- Differentiate between correlation and causation using real-world examples.
- Learn key methodologies for establishing causality (RCTs, natural experiments, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity design).
- Apply causal inference techniques using Python and Google Colab.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python (recommended, but not required)
- A Google account to use Google Colab
- Familiarity with statistics and probability concepts

### How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CuelllarC05/causal-inference-class.git

2. **Run Google Colab Notebooks**

- Open the notebooks/ folder and click on a .ipynb file.

- Use the Google Colab link to run the notebook directly in your browser.

3. Follow the Course Modules

- Start with the lectures/01_introduction/ folder.
- Complete the reading materials and in-class activities.
- Work through the coding exercises in notebooks/.
